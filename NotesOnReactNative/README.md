## What is React Native?
- A framework created by facebook initially in 2015.
- Lets you create mobile apps for ios and android using javascript.
- Technically hybrid but the app renders using real native UI components as opposed to webviews.
- It bridges code between JS code and native platform.
  
## Difference between native and hybrid mobile apps?
- You create two applications: one in swift or objective c for ios and one in java or kotlin for android / Use one condebase for both ios and android
- opportunities for fantastic user experiences / Cordova and iconic are examples of framework in hybrid applications.
- Since applications has to be created for both os it is time and money consuming / dont have greater UX but just a web app to run on a phone.

## What is view component?
In Android and iOS development, a view is the basic building block of UI: a small rectangular element on the screen which can be used to display text, images, or respond to user input.

## What is Native Components?
In Android development, you write views in Kotlin or Java; in iOS development, you use Swift or Objective-C. With React Native, you can invoke these views with JavaScript using React components. At runtime, React Native creates the corresponding Android and iOS views for those components. Because React Native components are backed by the same views as Android and iOS, React Native apps look, feel, and perform like any other apps. We call these platform-backed components Native Components.

## What are core components?
<View>: A non-scrolling <div>	A container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls

<Text>:	Displays, styles, and nests strings of text and even handles touch events

<Image>: Displays different types of images

<ScrollView>: A generic scrolling container that can contain multiple components and views

<TextInput>: Allows the user to enter text
