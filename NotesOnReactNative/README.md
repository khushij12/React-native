## What is React Native?
- A framework created by facebook initially in 2015.
- Lets you create mobile apps for ios and android using javascript.
- Technically hybrid but the app renders using real native UI components as opposed to webviews.
- It bridges code between JS code and native platform.
  
## Difference between native and hybrid mobile apps?
- You create two applications: one in swift or objective c for ios and one in java or kotlin for android / Use one condebase for both ios and android
- opportunities for fantastic user experiences / Cordova and iconic are examples of framework in hybrid applications.
- Since applications has to be created for both os it is time and money consuming / dont have greater UX but just a web app to run on a phone.
